Victor Vasarely, (born April 9, 1906 PÃ©cs, Hungary) was a Hungarian-French artist, who is widely accepted as a 
"grandfather" and leader of the op art movement. His work entitled Zebra, created in the 1930s, 
is considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of op art.
As we move through the year, there will be certain people who've contributed to the field that I expect you to know. There are so many great artists you could learn about... I've gathered materials for a decent selection spanning a fair variety of styles from both within the US, and overseas.

OLEG DOU

Contemporary | Russian

b: 1983 -

Oleg Dou was born into an artistic family in Moscow. His mother was a painter and his father a dress designer. Between visiting exhibitions and spending time in his mother's studio, he had a significant amount of exposure to art and artists. Despite his current fame, when younger he felt he was less talented than his younger brother.

Prior to the 1980s, artists in Russia were employed by the government. However, Gorbachev's policies reduced restrictions and gave unprecedented freedom of speech. This also allowed artists to set up galleries, work for patrons, and sell art to the public instead of only for the government. This would affect the sorts of art and artists Oleg would have exposure to.
