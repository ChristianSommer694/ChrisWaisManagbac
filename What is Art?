    What is Art?  
  The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines art as “something that is created with imagination and skill and
that is beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings.” 
  My own definition of art is the sharing of one's inner thoughts, feelings, emotions, visions, and struggles 
  through multiple mediums.
