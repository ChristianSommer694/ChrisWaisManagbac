    What is Art?  
  The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines art as “something that is created with imagination and skill and
that is beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings.” 
  My own definition of art is the sharing of one's inner thoughts, feelings, emotions, visions, and struggles 
  through multiple mediums.
    In my opinion some works of art dont count as art Because they dont have a story to them or there not about somebody.
    Art is Static and Dynamic because art can be 3d and 2d but you can still understand it.
    I cout art as art if you can make multiple storys about it. It doesnt count if it doesnt have a story behind it or about it.
