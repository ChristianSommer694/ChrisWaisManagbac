What is Op art (in my own words)?
Op art is shapes andd form created by patterns of lines.It can get really trippy but it usually just makes a 
normal picture.

Op art is short for 'optical art'. The word optical is used to describe things that relate to how we see. Have you seen an optical Illusion before? 
Op art works in a similar way.
Artists use shapes, colours and patterns in special ways to create images that look as if they are moving or blurring. 
Op art started in the 1960s and the painting above is by Bridget Riley who is one of the main op artists.

Op art, also called optical art, branch of mid-20th-century geometric abstract art that deals with optical illusion. Achieved through the systematic 
and precise manipulation of shapes and colours, the effects of Op art can be based either on perspective 
illusion or on chromatic tension; in painting, the dominant medium of Op art, the surface tension is usually maximized to
the point at which an actual pulsation or flickering is perceived by the human eye. In its concern with utterly abstract formal relationships, 
Op art is indirectly related to such other 20th-century styles as Orphism, Constructivism, Suprematism, and Futurism—particularly the latter because of 
its emphasis on pictorial movement and dynamism. The painters of this movement differed from earlier artists working in geometric styles, however, in their 
purposeful manipulation of formal relationships in order to evoke perceptual illusions, ambiguities, and contradictions in the vision of the viewer.

Op art (ŏp), movement that became prominent in the United States and Europe in the mid-1960s. 
Deriving from abstract expressionism, op art includes paintings concerned with surface kinetics.
Colors were used in creating visual effects, such as afterimages and trompe-l'oeil. 
Vibrating colors, concentric circles, and pulsating moiré patterns were characteristic of op works by such artists as Victor Vasarely, 
Richard Anusziewicz, Bridget Riley, Yaacov Agam, and Larry Poons. A comprehensive exhibition of op art, entitled 
"The Responsive Eye," was organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, in 1965.
